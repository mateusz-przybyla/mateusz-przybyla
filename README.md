## Hi, I'm Mateusz 👋

### 🚀 About Me
I'm a creative structural engineer specializing in reinforced concrete structures. One day I started coding and realized that it brings me a lot of satisfaction.
Right now, I spend a lot of time building my portfolio and consequently preparing to become a professional software/web developer.

### 🌱 At present
I'm taking part in the PrzyszlyProgramista.pl course.\
I'm currently learning Node.js and React.js.

### 🛠 Technologies used to build my portfolio
*** PHP *** MySQL *** C++ *** HTML *** CSS (+ Bootstrap) *** JavaScript ***

### ✔️ IT Achievements & Certificates
Very important thing is to learn from several sources. This provides a better understanding of the topics we are learning.\
